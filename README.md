# Sudoku Solver
Basic Python solver for 9x9 Sudoku with recursion and backtracking.

Feel free to use functions individually, making this program act as an assistant rather than an outright solver! 
Puzzles can be changed by editing the global puzzle list (0's represent blanks).
Although this program is designed for 9x9 Sudoku, it can be adapted fairly simply to accomodate larger puzzles (namely, the 'box' variables, which represent the puzzle grid).
